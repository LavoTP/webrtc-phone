## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [afterConnected(callback)](./sip.js.transport.afterconnected.md) |  |  |
|  [connect(options)](./sip.js.transport.connect.md) |  | Returns the promise designated by the child layer then emits a connected event. Automatically emits an event upon resolution, unless overrideEvent is set. If you override the event in this fashion, you should emit it in your implementation of connectPromise |
|  [connectPromise(options)](./sip.js.transport.connectpromise.md) |  | Called by connect, must return a promise promise must resolve to an object. object supports 1 parameter: overrideEvent - Boolean |
|  [disconnect(options)](./sip.js.transport.disconnect.md) |  | Returns the promise designated by the child layer then emits a disconnected event. Automatically emits an event upon resolution, unless overrideEvent is set. If you override the event in this fashion, you should emit it in your implementation of disconnectPromise |
|  [disconnectPromise(options)](./sip.js.transport.disconnectpromise.md) |  | Called by disconnect, must return a promise promise must resolve to an object. object supports 1 parameter: overrideEvent - Boolean |
|  [isConnected()](./sip.js.transport.isconnected.md) |  | Returns true if the transport is connected |
|  [onMessage(e)](./sip.js.transport.onmessage.md) |  | To be called when a message is received |
|  [send(msg, options)](./sip.js.transport.send.md) |  | Sends a message then emits a 'messageSent' event. Automatically emits an event upon resolution, unless data.overrideEvent is set. If you override the event in this fashion, you should emit it in your implementation of sendPromise |
|  [sendPromise(msg, options)](./sip.js.transport.sendpromise.md) |  | Called by send, must return a promise promise must resolve to an object. object supports 2 parameters: msg - string (mandatory) and overrideEvent - Boolean (optional) |
|  [waitForConnected()](./sip.js.transport.waitforconnected.md) |  | Returns a promise which resolves once the UA is connected. DEPRECATION WARNING: just use afterConnected() |

## Remarks

Abstract transport layer base class.
