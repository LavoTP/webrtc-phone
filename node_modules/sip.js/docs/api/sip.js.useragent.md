## Remarks

A user agent (UA) is associated with a user via the user's SIP address of record (AOR) and acts on behalf of that user to send and receive SIP requests. The user agent can register to receive incoming requests, as well as create and send outbound messages. The user agent also maintains the Transport over which its signaling travels.
